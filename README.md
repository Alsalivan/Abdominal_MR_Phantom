### Abdominal_MR_Phantom
Realistic 4D abdominal phantom for magnetic resonance imaging.

In the spirit of reproducible research, our 4D abdominal MR phantom is made available online to the community. The source codes are available as a MATLAB package and can be found at https://github.com/SeiberlichLab/Abdominal_MR_Phantom.

### Notes
The Abdominal_MR_Phantom source code includes phantom generation, data acquisition, and reconstruction.
Please start with the main script "main_phantom_generation.m".

- Part1: Phantom generation<br />
(1)	Define tissue properties and respiratory motion.<br />
(2)	Generate voxelized volumetric masks with indexes.<br />
- Part2: Data acquisition<br />
(1)	Define sequence parameters.<br />
(2)	Generate signal evolution using Bloch simulation.<br />
(3)	Generate k-space data for each time frame.<br />
- Part3: Data reconstruction and gridding
